# Multi-Domain Modelica Models of a Thermo-Mechanical Gas Turbine and an Electrical Power System for Integrated Simulation using Modelica Tools

Modelica models presented in a paper of the 2018 American Modelica Conference for the paper "Coalesced Gas Turbine and Power System Modeling and Simulation using Modelica".

This repository contains a Modelica Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) Multi-domain model based on components from the OpenIPSL and ThermoPower libraries. The package also includes the gas turbine and SMIB network models needed to build the multi-domain model. These Modelica-compliant models are briefly described in the following paper of the American Modelica Conference 2018:

> Miguel Aguilera, Luigi Vanfretti, Tetiana Bogodorova and Francisco Gómez, "Coalesced Gas Turbine and Power System Modeling and Simulation using Modelica", Proceedings of the 1st American Modelica Conference, 2018, Cambridge, MA, United States of America (in revision).

Please see the full paper for the documentation of the models.

The repository also provides the Modelica MAT results from the SMIB Power system-only and Multi-Domain models comparison and the Multi-Domain simulation, as discussed in the paper.
